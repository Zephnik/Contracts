#Terms of a Discord War 

This Contract (the Terms of a Discord War) may be legally referred to as "**the TOADW**". 
No more than 4 servers may have signed the TOADW simultaneously. 

***Point 1 (Signing the TOADW):***
Signing the TOADW is considered "*declaring war*". 
In order for a server to *declare war*, the declaring server's **owner** sends a message in their own server (and in all other servers that have *declared war*), 
saying "**[server name] officially takes part in the [amount of previously finished wars, plus 1]. Discord War.**".
The channels in which this message is published must be available to *all* members of the server. 
The message sent inside the **declaring server** must include "**@everyone**". 
Servers that have fewer members than the signed server with the lowest amount of members *or* more members than the signed server with the highest amount of members, 
that server **must have** permission from all other servers that have *declared war* before *declaring war*. 

One of the following Discord users must also confirm publicly that they acknowledge each *declaration of war*:
@Zephnik#4897

The people in the list above have authority to deem an action illegal and unaffected by the TOADW. 
They are also authorized to edit the TOADW at any time. Should one of these people do something the majority of votes are against, that person loses all previously mentioned authority. 
A "vote" as mentioned in the line above, is initiated by a public request, and acceptance by a signed server's owner. 
Votes can not be initiated if only one person is listed above. 
Votes happen by using the website *www.strawpoll.com*. 

***Point 2 (Unsigning the TOADW):***
If not ALL requirements mentioned in the TOADW are fulfilled by each server that has *declared war*, 
that server has *surrendered*, and the server's name will be removed from this document. The TOADW no longer applies to that server. 
One of the Discord users from the list above (point 1, lines 6-6) must confirm publicly that they acknowledge that server's *surrender*. 

***Point 3 (Mandatory server changes):***
All servers that have *declared war* must have a channel called "#war-participants". 
In this channel, only members with an authoritative title in the respective server may send messages. 
The only messages that are to be sent in #war-participants, are invite links to the other servers that have *declared war*. 
These channels will serve as a tool to observe the amount of members in each server that has *declared war*. 

***Point 4 (Winning and ending a war):*** 
If there are *one* or fewer servers that have signed the TOADW, that means no war is active yet. 
If there were more servers involved in the war (that *surrendered*), the one remaining server *wins* the war instead. 
There are two ways for a server to *win* a Discord war: 
- Be the only server that is still noted in this document (under "Currently active wars"). To meet this condition, the same war must have had more than one server in it earlier. 
- Be the first to reach an amount of members higher than *X*. 
*X* is a number that is agreed on by the two first servers to *declare war*. If it is desired, *www.strawpoll.com* can again be used to decide what *X* is. 

As soon as a server *wins* a Discord war, that war's name and result result is noted on the bottom of this document (as controlled by the people listed in point 1, lines 6-6). 
All servers that have *declared war* will, at the moment of someone *winning*, be removed from this document (and instead be noted under "Previously finished wars"). 



***Currently active wars:***

***Previously finished wars:***
